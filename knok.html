              <h1 id="hero-article" >Knok Healthcare</h1>
              <h2>April 2017 </h2>
              <p>Knok is an early stage ‘Uber-style’ private health care platform founded by Jose Bastos.
                The idea came up when his children fell ill and Jose was unable to book an appointment with
                a doctor. Currently based in Portugal, Knok gives patients access to on-demand and in-person
                medical support. This is achieved through a native mobile app and web-application that allows
                patients to find doctors around them, request immediate home visits and pay for the appointment.
                Knok has displayed clear product-market fit (PMF) with strong growth in appointments with a
                large number of soft-traction points also achieved including pitching at WIRED, Health 2.0 and
                Porto Business School, with coverage on Portuguese TV and Forbes.
              </p>

              <img src="./assets/knok-team.jpeg" alt="The team behind the Knok app">

              <p>The team has also since grown to incorporate four additional co-founders in Pedro Vieira e
                Moreira, Antonio Miranda, Carolina Relvas and Iterar, with the business now bringing skill sets
                across finance, risk management, engineering and medicine. The Company has leveraged these skills
                to build an exciting healthcare product that has evolved meaningfully from the initial offering
                of premium only, to a more inclusive product at a highly competitive price point. This transition
                has resulted in compelling growth rates with a 330% growth in appointments, 250% growth in revenues
                and 55% growth in registered patients since February.
              </p>
              <p>For this 2 weeks design sprint, I teamed up with two of my classmates: Adolfo Sabino and Spencer
                Spottiswoode. When Knok reached out to us, they were about to develop their new video chat feature,
                but they were struggling to find a way to integrate it into their existing app. Their existing
                version at the time was designed having in mind the on-demand service exclusively. This is
                where our opportunity happened.</p>

              <img src="./assets/knok1.png" alt="The opportunity">

              <h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
              <p>When it comes to telemedicine, we quickly realized that while offering some great
                advantages, this kind of service could be really challenging to put in place. To better
                understand the possibilities of that feature and its limitations, we started by talking to
                doctors. Here are some of the key takeaways.
              </p>
              <p>Pros:
                <br />—  Great way to show involvement to patients
                <br />—  Maintains good relationship
                <br />—  Ability to check on treatment’s efficiency
              </p>
              <p>Cons:
                <br />—  Consultations/intervention very limited (prescriptions might not always be possible)
                <br />—  Can only provide medical advice most of the time
              </p>
              <p>Having a better vision of the constraints for our design, we started the user research.</p>

              <img src="./assets/knok2.png" alt="Doctor's quote">

              <h3>User Research</h3>

              <p>After 101survey responses that we converted into 17 user’s interviews, we decided to put
                together all the answers through an affinity map and started looking for patterns. Our key
                findings from patients interviews are the following:
              </p>
              <p>Current way users handle real-life operations:
                <br />— Visits frequency: mostly regular visits
                <br />— Scheduling: mostly done over the phone but open to other options (email/through the website)
                <br />—  Choosing a doctor:  a lot of family doctor/family recommendations. Key elements when
                looking for a new doctor are  empathy, reliability & availability.
              </p>
              <p>Variable affecting feelings towards a doctor:
                <br />— Satisfaction: patients want to feel heard, they want the doctor to be clear and they
                want to leave the consultation feeling like they have a good understanding of their situation.
                <br />— Treatment expectations: practices generally match user’s expectations, although most of
                the interrogated people were open to alternative medicine & treatments.
                <br />— Frustrations: when  appointments are not on time , being exposed to illnesses in the
                waiting room and private information being badly handled.
              </p>
              <p>Impressions on video calls
                <br />Existing systems: a majority of people prefer Facetime for a few reasons; quality of
               the calls, having no login, works with a lot of contacts and already integrated to the phone.
                <br />— Remote contact with doctors: people liked the idea of remote medicine, most had a
                first contact remotely.
                <br />— Follow up: more acceptable for video calls as people like to feel the doctor cares
                even after the appointment is over.
                <br />— Telemedicine feature: high expectations from patients, but would save time and avoid
               commuting for no reason.
             </p>

             <img src="./assets/knok3.png" alt="Patient's quote">

             <h4>At that point, we understood our main challenge was to make sure users can easily identify
               the difference between the home visits and video calls in order to understand the value of each
               appointment type available and fully enjoy the advantages of both options.
             </h4>

             <p>The next question for us to answer was who are we designing for? From all the data collected
                during our research, we started building our primary and secondary personas to make sure we will
                provide the right solution to the right users.
             </p>

             <h3>Meet our users: Maria & Manoel</h3>
             <p>Maria is 35, she’s a mother of 2 and she wants to take care of her family’s health easily and
               efficiently. Her main frustration comes from the difficulty to find available doctors nearby.
               Manoel is a 77 years old retired fisherman and he needs to get regular medical check-ups to
               keep track of the effects of his multiple treatments. His main pain point is his restricted
               mobility, making him dependent on his family for every medical appointment.
             </p>

             <img src="./assets/knok4.png" alt="Patient's quote">
             <p>We decided to focus on Maria for two important reasons: One, when looking at the market
               research provided to us at the beginning of this sprint, we saw that Maria’s persona fits
               the profile for Knok’s existing client base. The second reason is that Maria is the one looking
               after the health of her family and being in charge of two young children with a very busy life,
               she is the most inclined to be interested in the telemedicine feature.
             </p>

             <h4>After putting together all our research we were able to define a solution for our primary
               user. We needed to design a new home screen and restructure the current flow to make sure both
               home and video appointments flow can coexist seamlessly, and still be clearly distinguished by Maria.
             </h4>

             <img src="./assets/knok5.png" alt="User journey">

             <p>The next step for us was to map out Maria’s journey when she needs to get an appointment
               for her sick child. When noticing the illness of her son, she would start to feel worried
               and look for help. She would open the Knok app and start looking for a doctor nearby.
               Finding doctors available for an immediate video chat would help Maria feel reassured as
               she can get the right medical advice. After getting the doctor’s opinion on her child’s
               condition, Maria feels relieved and knows she can take care of her son properly.
             </p>
             <p>Having a better understanding of Maria’s needs and pain points, we started the define phase
               of our solution. We started by establishing our 3 design principles.
             </p>

             <img src="./assets/knok6.png" alt="Design Principles">

             <p>Simplicity: the journey of Maria through the app needs to be as simple and easy as possible,
               we don’t want to add any unnecessary stress to a mother looking after a sick child.
               <br />Clear: the app and each feature have to be clearly understood by Maria and communicate
               it’s action in the most effective way possible.
               <br />Trustworthy: Knok’s doctors are all qualified professionals and it’s very important to
               make sure Maria is aware of it and reassured on the doctor she’s going to welcome in her house.
             </p>

            <h3>Define Phase</h3>
            <p>We then took those design principles into a design studio session with Tiago (the product
              manager) and Andre (the iOS developer) during which we wanted to generate as many ideas as we
              could and find a way to align all of our visions on the same product.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok7.png" alt="Design Studio Key Takeaways">

            <p>During these 2h30, we came up with three important points that seemed key to the improvement
              of Maria’s experience:
              <br />- New filtering system: adding a new feature means adding a new goal for our users
              and implies a different way to search for doctors. We needed to explore the different ways
              users would be looking for medical help to understand the best way to filter doctors.
              <br />- Doctor’s summary: because of these new needs and goals, we had to provide user's
              information to help them choose between all the doctors nearby. Following our design principles,
              clear and simple, we wanted to avoid users having to open each doctor’s profile to be able to
              access that information.
              <br />- Effortless navigation: now offering two very distinct types of appointments, we had
              to ensure Maria would easily understand the options available and be able to choose one without
              any confusion.
            </p>
            <p>From these first sketches, our team put together a paper prototype merging the existing screens
              of the app to the design studio ideas and we put that prototype to the test.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok8.png" alt="Paper Prototype">

            <p>After a few tests, we decided to digitize the prototype into low fidelity and test it again
              to have a better understanding of the challenges our users were facing.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok9.png" alt="Paper Prototype - user feedback">

            <p>The first iteration we worked on was the home screen/filtering system. On the first version
              of the prototype, the app would open straight away to a view of the map minimized at the top
              and the search fields on the bottom half of the screen. During testing, we realized our users
              were overwhelmed by all this information and slightly confused by the map.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok10.png" alt="User Testing">

            <p>We knew the location of doctors was important information for users when choosing a practician,
               even for a video call, as they all mentioned during interviews that they would feel more
               comfortable to know the doctor wasn’t too far away. But displaying that information before even
               giving the chance to users to start searching was actually quite disturbing for them.
            </p>
            <p>For the second prototype, we tried to take the map showing the doctor’s location away and
              separated each step of the filtering process on two distinct screens to focus our user’s attention
              on only one information. We also added a message directly addressed to users with a friendly
              and more personal tone of voice.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok11.png" alt="Prototype v2">

            <p>After a couple of tests of that second prototype, we realized users really enjoyed being
              addressed personally and felt more trust in the service. They also appreciated the different
              steps of the search process being separated but felt like a different screen each time was a
              bit too much and felt like a longer process than it really is.
            </p>
            <h4>After testing different versions of the same prototype, my team and I felt a bit stuck.
              We were moving the same elements around and something was still quite not working, so we decided
              to part ways and spend an evening working on a new version separately. We wanted to challenge
              our vision of the filtering system and come up with 3 very different takes on this design,
              just like we did during the design studio but now taking in consideration all the knowledge
              that we had from the results of our tests.
            </h4>

            <img src="./assets/knok12.png" alt="Prototype v3">

            <p>The day after, we presented our individual sketches to each other, merged and refined these
              new takes on the filtering process and put together a third prototype. The personal tone of
              voice that our users trusted was now put forward and directly guiding users through each
              individual step. We made the previous choices still visible, playing with opacity to keep users
              focused on the current choice, and limited the search process to one screen.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok13.png" alt="Prototype v3 - user feedback">

            <p>Another part of the flow that was specifically challenging for us was the doctor profile as
              users were struggling with two different issues at that stage of the journey. First, the fact
              that all appointments cost the same price across all doctors of the same speciality wasn’t
              communicated efficiently, the prices being displayed on the doctor’s page would push user’s to
              associate the amount to that doctor. Second, the availability of the doctor. Even though only
              available doctors would be shown in the search result, users, having learned in real life that
              they had to book appointments with doctors, weren’t able to understand that the doctors displayed
              on the map were online and available right now.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok14.png" alt="Prototype v4">

            <p>So when designing our second prototype, we decided to add clear icons and status on the doctor’s
               page as well as on their summary card visible on the map. We also removed the prices from the
               doctor’s profile and tried to specify the prices during the filtering process, associating the
               prices to the appointment type. While the availability status and the icons worked very well with users,
               seeing a price so early in the flow made users feel like the service was too sales-driven.
            </p>
            <p>In response to user tests, for our third prototype, we tried moving the price later in the flow.
               After selecting a doctor, users would confirm the type of appointment they need. What was a
               filter option at the beginning of the flow now becomes a choice of service. When tapping
               “next”, users were then directed to the payment page where the price was clearly associated
               with the type of appointment selected. After further testing, we confirmed that this flow was a
               lot clearer for users and solved the problem of associating the price of the consultation to
               each doctor.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok15.png" alt="Prototype v5">

            <h3>Final Prototype</h3>
            <p>After two weeks of research and testing, we put together a final prototype that managed to
              integrate a new appointment type to the original flow, with a redesigned home page, a new filtering
              system and an overall better experience.
            </p>

            <img src="./assets/knok16.gif" alt="Final prototype">
            <img src="./assets/knok17.gif" alt="Final prototype">

            <h3>Next Steps</h3>
            <p>Redesign the doctor flow: after improving the app on the patient side, we would like to have the
              chance to improve the doctor’s flow while incorporating the video appointment feature and improve
              the experience for both users of Knok.
            </p>
            <p>Improve the rating system: very early during our testing phase, we realized that the current star
              rating system Knok uses to get feedback on their doctors is actually off-putting for the majority
              of users. The stars feel really dehumanizing and aren’t a complete enough evaluation for a doctor.
              Even though we tried different rating system, during this sprint we didn’t get enough time to
              really dive in that problem and we would like to explore new ways for Knok’s patients to rate their
              experience.
            </p>
            <p>Follow up notifications: when conducting interviews with patients and doctors, we found out the
              relationship and the trust that is built between the two parts is the key element of any healthcare
              service. To allow both patients and doctors to be able to recreate that connection online, we would
              like to explore a way to schedule follow-ups video calls and trigger reminder notifications from
              the app.
            </p>
            <p>On-boarding: now offering a new service, we would like to help Knok educate their new users
              about the functionalities the app offers.
            </p>
