            <h1 id="hero-article">Google Design Challenge</h1>
            <h2>May 2018</h2>
            <p>As part of my interview process for the position of Interaction Designer
              for the Google Cloud Platform, I was given the opportunity to design a concept product.
              I had the chance to choose between 3 different challenges, and - as a big animal
              lover - I naturally decided to pick the following one:</p>
            <h4>“Millions of animals are currently in shelters and foster homes awaiting adoption.
              Design an experience that will help connect people looking for a new pet with the
              right companion for them. Help an adopter find a pet which matches their lifestyle,
              considering factors including breed, gender, age, temperament, and health status.”</h4>
            <img src="./assets/google1.png" alt="Pet adopter">
            <h3>Step One</h3>
            <h2>Find a space for the product</h2>
            <p>As this challenge aims to design a product for Google, I wanted to make sure
              there would be space for the output to live in within the large range of Google offering.
              Pet rescue services mainly surviving on donations and government fundings, Google.org
              felt like the natural place to provide a solution helping reduce the number of abandoned
              animals around the world.
              The product would be a chance for animal rescue programs to benefit from the
              technological progress and design expertise from a giant of the tech industry while
              providing Google with a new area to tackle in terms of social innovations.</p>
            <h3>Step Two</h3>
            <h2>Analyse the market</h2>
            <p>The first thing I decided to look at was the business needs and limitations. In order
              to design a great experience for potential future pet owners, it was important for me
              to understand how shelters work. This research would also give me the chance to challenge
              the product and maybe spot some unexpected opportunities that could come complement the
              matching feature.</p>
            <p>This first key takeaway that came out of that research is quite a positive one, as
              according to the Animal Humane Society, 2017 was the most successful year to date.
              Over 96% of the animals rescued were successfully placed, including 20,062 adoptions by
              new families, and the average stay for animals in shelters dropped to 10.1 days only.
              This is not only great news for our furry friends but also indicates a great
              product/market fit for the app, as more and more people get into the “adopt, don’t shop”
              philosophy.</p>
            <div id="two-col">
              <h4 class="two-column" style="padding-top: 50px;">“More than 96% of the animals in our care were placed in homes, reunited with owners,
                or released to other animal welfare organisations”</h4>
              <img class="two-column" src="./assets/google2.png" alt="Adoption statistics">
            </div>
            <p>Despite these encouraging numbers, shelters are still facing some major challenges.
              The biggest issue is obviously covering all their expenses. Food, toys, medical care;
              the list goes on and on. As most shelters run on donations and small government help,
              it can be really hard to make the ends meet each month.
              <br>After the material resources, finding volunteers is another big challenge for animal
              shelters. All these pets need daily attention and it doesn’t stop at just feeding them and
              cleaning their spaces. To make sure pets will be easily adopted it’s really important they
              get a lot of exposure to humans and get a lot of time to play and stay happy.
              The people volunteering are usually outnumbered by the animals and unfortunately can’t spend
              as much time as they would want with animals individually.</p>
            <p>Another important point that surfaced from the research was the number of pets returning
              to the shelter.  According to the AHS, 42% of adopted pets are returned after just 6 months
              in their new families. For these animals, their chances of surviving are instantly diminished
              as shelters are forced to put categorize them as “unplaceable” and automatically put them at
              the top of the list for euthanasia. In a lot of cases, those pets are returned because owners
              based their decision on the “look” of the animal instead of its personality, or they weren’t
              informed enough on the amount of money, time and responsibilities required. With a better
              understanding of the animal rescue system, it was now time for me to have a look at my
              users' needs.</p>
            <h3>Step Three</h3>
            <h2>User needs & frustrations</h2>
            <p>Almost half of UK households have pets. In America, there are more pets than children.
              The desire to welcome a companion is widely spread across all cultures, but adopting an
              animal isn’t a decision one can make on the spur of the moment and needs to be carefully
              considered. The most important thing for people considering adoption is to find a pet that
              would suit their lifestyle. Everyone has different budgets, jobs, houses and it is crucial for
              users to commit to a pet that will fit in the family so both parts can be happy.</p>
            <p>When committing to such a big decision, users want to be well informed. There are many pets
              to choose from and knowing in advance the average cost of each breed, their behaviours and
              specific needs before even stepping into a shelter to visit a specific animal. The second
              step is to get familiar with a pet after having a chance to review their profile. Most users
              value pet visits, as they give them a chance to get to know the exact personality of their
              prospective new roommate.</p>
            <p>The last important finding that came out of that user research was the reliability of
              the shelter. Users want to know that the animal they’re about to adopt has been inspected
              properly and that the volunteers are being honest with its health status or age. People
              are actually happy to go through an assessment process as it shows the shelter isn’t just
              trying to get rid of the animal as fast as possible.</p>
            <img src="./assets/google3.png" alt="Pet adopter">
            <p>For this specific project, there is actually a secondary user to consider as much as
              the primary one. A user that can’t speak for himself but requires to be heard: the pets.
              To ensure the adoption process will result in a joyful experience for both the owner and
              the animal, it is essential for pets to be matched with responsible and caring owners,
              that will be able to provide a suitable environment, appropriate training as well as
              support their basic needs.</p>
            <p>To be able to make that perfect match, all animals need to be considered and presented
              to prospective owners. Dogs and cats are the obvious options when people talk about pets,
              but there is a lot more to adopt. Snake, fish, rabbit, bird; they very occasionally end up
              in shelters but they could easily be adopted by people that don’t have an outdoor space
              for a cat or the time to walk a dog; so it’s essential that prospective owner know when
              some of them are looking for a new home.</p>
            <h3>Step Four</h3>
            <h2>Definition of the solution</h2>
            <p>After gathering all these insights and looking at the problem from the different points
              of view, I decided to use affinity mapping to group the key findings and find unexpected
              relationships between key findings that would help me shape a better solution. Here are
              the 3 areas I decided to focus based on the result of that exercise:</p>
            <div id="three-col">
              <div class="three-column">
                <h3>Display pets by lifestyle instead of breed</h3>
                <p>Prospective owners would get to fill in a survey inquiring about their environment
                  and their personality before accessing to pets profiles. That way, the app could help
                  reduce the number of animals returning to the shelter after owners have been disappointed.
                  It will also provide more chances for animals that are less in demand to be considered
                  for adoption.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="three-column">
                <h3>Turn pet visits on site in care time for the pet</h3>
                <p>That way, prospective owners get to spend time with the animal and get a better idea
                  of how they would behave during daily tasks, reducing the chance of bad surprises once
                  the pet is home. The pet could get to know their family and the shelter workers will be
                  able to assess if they could be a great match for each other. That would also allow
                  volunteers to be resourced in a more efficient way, they would be able to look after pets
                  that no one came to visit that day.</p>
              </div>
              <div class="three-column">
                <h3>Educate owners on the real cost of owning a pet </h3>
                <p>Living with an animal has a price, for the shelter just as much as for owners. By
                  providing specific and targeted opportunities to donate money and informing prospective
                  owners on how exactly it would be spent in the shelter, they will at the same time get
                  a better idea of the unexpected expenses of having a pet at home.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
            <img src="./assets/google4.png" alt="Affinity mapping">
            <h3>Step Five</h3>
            <h2>Mapping the design</h2>
            <p>With all these considerations in mind and a better idea of the challenges, I started
              sketching. First thing I decided to do would be the user flow, as I wanted to see where
              the cost education pages and donations call to action could live while ensuring the
              experience could be seamless for prospective owners.</p>
            <p>It was also essential for me to make sure I would stay focused on providing an effective
              MVP for this app while still keeping in mind the future of the product. Considering the
              brief, the core of my app is to match adopters and pets according to their lifestyle and
              personalities, which I used as the scenario for that user flow.</p>
            <img src="./assets/google5.png" alt="User flow">
            <h3>Step Six</h3>
            <h2>Sketches & mockups</h2>
            <p>After establishing a clear road map for my solution, it was time to start sketching the
              screens and place the different elements that would guide future adopters through the
              product. Here are a few photos of the sketching process:</p>
