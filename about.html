          <h1 id="hero-article">Let's get to know <br>each other</h1>
          <p>I am a UX designer that enjoys solving problems and turning solutions into effective
            and beautiful products. I, firstly, did a BA in Creative Pattern Making in South of France
            which helped me being familiar with vector drawing and
            develop a keen eye for detail. After my first internship as a pattern maker, I realised
            that I wanted to explore more disruptive and technological products and turned myself to
            the UX Immersive course at General Assembly.
            <br>
            <br>After an initial experience as the first UX Designer at
            FX Digital, I decided to come back on campus to work as an Instructor Associate.
            I had the chance to work alongside three different Senior Designers and Lead Instructors.
            I then decided to join the Experience Team at Hugo&Cat where I have the great pleasure
            to work alongside talented people on challenging and compelling projects for a year and a half.
            Following that experience, I joined the brilliant UX team at Brilliant Basics where I currently work.</p>

          <h3>Some nice things people have said about me:</h3>
          <p class="testimonial-left">"Working with Mariane is always a pleasure. In addition to her
            strong thinking and communication skills, Mariane brings two essential things to projects:
            excellent delivery and great collaboration. Her creative confidence and original personality
            makes her creative inputs always surprising and elevating for the projects we worked on
            together. Her insights are clearly communicated and presented in a visually pleasing way,
            which is a direct result of her thinking AND doing. With a curious mind, she goes beyond
            design and brings valuable references to the project team."

          <p class="testimonial-right">‚ÄúMariane is a talented and passionate UX Designer. She approaches
            each challenge with creativity, thoughtfulness, and determination. As a student in the
            UX Design Immersive program, her individual and team projects demonstrated exemplary
            exploration and application of UX tools and methods. Following the course, I was happy
            to see her return to GA to join the instructional team. It was a pleasure to work with her.
            She provided quality feedback to the students, and supported the delivery of the program
            on a day-to-day basis. Mariane would be an excellent addition to any design team, and I
            look forward to working with her in the future.‚Äù

          <p class="testimonial-left">"Working with Spencer, Simi and Mariane was an excellent experience
            for Knok Healthcare. We are including new layers of services to our app and the GA students
            played a key role in developing a clutter-free and optimised UX for our patients. The team
            liked it and so did our investors. We were working on a tight schedule, nevertheless, the
            students were very thorough in their analysis and quick on their deliverables - which was great!
            We are now very keen to keep working with the team who has done this for us because we have
            many additional features to add and we know we couldn‚Äôt be with better people!"
