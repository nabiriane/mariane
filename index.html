        <h2>In-Store Digital Experience</h2>
        <p>When Swarovski decided to redesign their entire store experience to attract millennials, Hugo & Cat
          had the chance to collaborate with UXUS (consumer experience), Urquiola (interior designs) and Light iQ (light design)
          to define the experience for the digital ecosystem.
          <br>
          <br>For that project, I had the opportunity to run user-tests on their current in-store touchpoints
          and work closely with the various designers to define the purpose and concept of each digital touchpoint.

        <h1>Game of Thrones AR</h1>
        <h2>Proof of Concept for Ireland.com</h2>
        <p>In celebration of season 7 of Game of Thrones, Tourism Ireland commissioned an 80 meters
          long medieval-style tapestry depicting every episode of the show. Hugo & Cat, as their digital
          partners, created a <a href="https://www.ireland.com/features/game-of-thrones-tapestry/" class="inlinelink" target="_blank">website</a> to allow users to visualise the tapestry.
          <br>
          <br>A few months later,
          I was asked to test out possible AR applications and concepts that would encourage users to
          engage with Ireland.com content through an immersive experience. I had the opportunity
          to design an AR proof of concept allowing users to unravel the tapestry in their own home, reusing
          assets and development work from the existing digital platform.

        <p>Hugo & Cat was tasked to support the sub-brands of StanleyBlack&Decker in their marketing
          planning activities. To inform those future schedules, my team and I ran a series of workshops
          for Dewalt, Stanley Tools and Facom.
          <br>
          <br>Following these sessions, I produced personas and customer journey maps for each of the
          brands, helped them identify opportunities matching their individual goals and supported
          them in their prioritisation tasks.

        <p>When Shimano announced their intention to open an Experience Centre, Hugo & Cat had a chance

          cycling, fishing and rowing enthusiasts from around the world to enjoy a multidimensional sensorial
          experience.
          <br>
          <br>Based on the 3D  models of the space, we had 2 weeks to identify the three key personas
          matching the 3 disciplines as well as concept, design and mockup each digital touchpoint.

        <h1>Digital addiction, </h1>
        <h2>choose to design for a tech/life balance.</h2>
        <p>During the summer of 2018, surveys suggested that 40% of smartphone owners had developed some sort of
          digital-related addiction, and 70% of those users wanted helped to manage their
          smartphone consumption.
          <br>
          <br>Hugo&Cat asked me to reflect on these new user's expectations towards digital health and how the industry was adapting. Could this
          be the start of significant change in our relationship with technology? And how did we get here in the first place?
